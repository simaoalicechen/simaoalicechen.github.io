## Projects
### NYC Eviction Features and Trends from 83,282 records (current status: paper under review)
-- Thoroughly cleaned and analyzed NYC eviction records, building attributes, 311 complaints, social vulnerability data, economic metrics, and gentrification proxies to examine their correlation with NYC eviction trends and patterns 
-- Exhaustively investigated these 60+ potentially contributing factors through longitudinal (Time Series), spatial (ArcGIS), statistical, and machine learning techniques(Random Forest Regression, XGBoost, SHAP values, Linear Regression) at the unit, building, zipcode, and neighborhood level 
-- Concluded that racial composition and socialeconomics were persistent and dominating factors, including historical redlining - Discovered that building types and maintenance were influential, such as buildings with 100 plus annual complaints were 40 times more likely to experince higher evictions; car ownership also appeared to be a previously unconsidered driver, as areas with higher car ownership (much higher expenses than using public transportation) correlated strongly with places with higher eviction rates 
-- Indicated that tightened municipal requirements for rental unit maintenance, inspection, and fines could improve housing quality while decreasing evictions.

### Generative Adversarial Network training on CelebA      
-- Created and evaluated a range of GAN models for generating realistic images, focused on diverse architectures like DCGAN, WGAN, and Relativistic GAN using the CelebA dataset in a team of 2.   
-- Conducted detailed experiments, including training variations and optimization techniques, to improve image generation quality and efficiency.    

### ResNet Models to train and test on CIFAR-10 image datasets for a Kaggle Competition 
-- Developed and evaluated various ResNet architectures for CIFAR-10 image classification in a team of 2, achieving a best accuracy of 97.0% on test data.   
-- Conducted extensive experiments on hyperparameters and model variations, documenting results and optimization strategies in Jupyter Notebooks.    

### High School Finder App “Shortlist” – Python, Vue, Django    
-- Contributed to the development of Shortlist™, a web application that matches middle school students and their parents with high schools in NYC, using Vue, Django, and AWS technologies.    
-- Collaborated on diverse aspects of the project including UI/UX design, backend integration, and deployment, enhancing the application’s functionality and user experience.

### Airbnb House Price Prediction Model      
-- Developed a predictive model for Airbnb rental prices using machine learning techniques in Jupyter Notebook.      
-- Analyzed and visualized housing data to identify key price determinants, enhancing accuracy in price prediction models.     

### Java Yahtzee DB Socket Project   
-- Developed a Java-based Yahtzee game with database and socket integration for real-time multiplayer functionality.   
-- Implemented robust game logic and GUI, and managed backend operations for storing player statistics and game scores.    

### Airbnb DataBase SQL Python Streamlit Project
-- Developed a Q&A model for Airbnb rental prices using SQL and Python.    
-- Analyzed and visualized housing data using StreamLit frontend functions help customers to identify critical pricing and neighborhood information to better prepare trips.
