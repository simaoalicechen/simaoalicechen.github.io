## Projects
### NYC Landlord Behavior Data Science Project     
-- Conducting a comprehensive data science project analyzing NYC landlord behavior by integrating and cross-referencing eviction, 311 complaints, and BBL datasets, uncovering correlations between property-related complaints and eviction rates during and post-COVID.   
-- Developing advanced visualizations using Plotly and Folium to identify eviction patterns and neighborhood-level influences in NYC.     
-- Applying k-means clustering to detect significant eviction and complaint data patterns, identifying groups of buildings and neighborhoods with similar risks.     
-- Performing local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and moral analysis to investigate spatial clustering, uncovering localized eviction trends and their socioeconomic impacts and comparing this method with k-means.    

### Generative Adversarial Network training on CelebA      
-- Created and evaluated a range of GAN models for generating realistic images, focused on diverse architectures like DCGAN, WGAN, and Relativistic Gan using the CelebA dataset in a team of 2.   
-- Conducted detailed experiments, including training variations and optimization techniques, to improve image generation quality and efficiency.    

### ResNet Models to train and test on CIFAR-10 image datasets for a Kaggle Competition 
-- Developed and evaluated various ResNet architectures for CIFAR-10 image classification in a team of 2, achieving a best accuracy of 97.0% on test data.   
-- Conducted extensive experiments on hyperparameters and model variations, documenting results and optimization strategies in Jupyter Notebooks.    

### High School Finder App “Shortlist” – Python, Vue, Django    
-- Contributed to the development of Shortlist™, a web application that matches middle school students and their parents with high schools in NYC, using Vue, Django, and AWS technologies.    
-- Collaborated on diverse aspects of the project including UI/UX design, backend integration, and deployment, enhancing the application’s functionality and user experience.
